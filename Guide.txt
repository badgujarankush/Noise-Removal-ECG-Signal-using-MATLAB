This a 2nd year ECE Project which simulates the removal of noise from ECG Signal using MATLAB.
There are mainly three kinds of noise produced in ECG signal 1) Baseline Noise 2) Powerline 3)EMG Noise
EMG noise is difficult to remove( PS: i couldn't find a way to remove that xd)

1) Add both the project file (project.m) and the data files which have pre-recorded ECG data which are corrupted with noise.
2) The code contains basically 4 sections...First one to read the data file...Second to remove baseline (low freq noise)....Third to check the freq response to identify the high freq noise..
   Fourth one to remove the particular high freq noise(mainly its gonna be 60Hz)
3) Change the file name in first section when working with different data files.. and change the value of the width(w) in the last section of low-pass notch filter.
4) Run the program and observe the Graphs.
